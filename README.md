🏡 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

📌 Overview

This project aims to predict house prices based on various features using Linear Regression. The model is trained on historical housing data to provide price estimates for new listings. The project demonstrates the application of Supervised Machine Learning techniques, particularly Linear Regression, for predictive analytics.

✨ Features

🛠 Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling, encoding categorical data)

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

🤖 Model Training using Linear Regression

📈 Model Evaluation with performance metrics

🔮 Predictions on new house data

🛠 Technologies Used

🐍 Python

📝 Pandas (Data Manipulation)

🔢 NumPy (Numerical Computation)

📊 Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)

🎯 Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning Library)

📂 Dataset

The dataset includes various attributes of houses, such as:

🏠 Square footage

🛏 Number of bedrooms & bathrooms

📍 Location

🏗 Year built

🚗 Additional features (garage, pool, etc.)

🚀 Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/House-Price-Prediction.git
cd House-Price-Prediction

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
